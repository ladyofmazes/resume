class activity sheets.<br>
University of Rochester, Rochester, NY<br>
Graduate Teaching Assistant<br>
2006-2007<br>
Lead non-class recitation, answering questions<br>
with structured discussions. Made solutions for<br>
and graded homework and tests.<br>
Local Low Energy Analysis Coordinator<br>
Coordinate the activities UW Madisons local low energy working group. Schedule and plan meet-<br>
ings, facilitate discussions, provide student mentoring.<br>
DeepCore Working Group Simulation Production Liaison<br>
Coordinate with IceCube sim- ulation production leadership and DeepCore Working Group Leader<br>
to efficiently produce simu- lation for DeepCore Working Group analyses<br>
IceCube Early Career Scientist Representative<br>
Represent the needs of the young PhD scientists on IceCube on the collaboration board. Drafted a<br>
proposal to improve the publication process in IceCube based on Early Career Scientists feedback<br>
and presented the proposal in front of the collaboration for discussion.<br>
IceCube Software BootCamp Event Organizer (2013-2014)<br>
I scheduled the speakers, invited students and assessed the level of software instruction that should<br>
be offered based on a survey of their proficiency, planned the talks based on available presenters and<br>
survey results, organized the setup and supervised the presentations. I also gave a one hour talk on<br>
basic plot making and a four hour talk on an overview of the basic use of IceCube software for the<br>
bootcamps.<br>
WIPAC High School Internship Mentor<br>
<hr>
<A name=2></a>Drafted an overview talk accessibly describing the neutrino physics reach of IceCube. Created and<br>
taught a curriculum using existing outreach materials for five weeks of two hour sessions to teach<br>
the basics of electronics and computer programming using Arduino microcontrollers.<br>
Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) Presenter<br>
Created an hour long interactive activity to present for the EYH program, which aims to get middle<br>
school girls interested in science. They interacted cooperatively to identify features of galaxies and<br>
then discussed the merits of scientific consensus. I also introduced them to the Galaxy Zoo and<br>
taught them how to identify galaxies using this tool to contribute to actual scientific publications.<br>
Mentor for Moriah Tobin (University of Wisconsin-Madison<br>
Graduate student working on muon neutrino disappearance result. Worked to develop analysis and<br>
publication strategy for PhD work.<br>
Mentor for Michael Larson (Niels Bohr Institute)<br>
Graduate student working on tau neutrino appearance result. Worked on producing simulation to<br>
reduce uncertainty in the tau neutrino appearance result.<br>
Mentor for Adam Bublitz (NSF-MRI)<br>
Undergraduate student working on MINERvA. Did work testing PMTs and scintillator planes.<br>
Mentor for Josh Powell (Uber)<br>
Intern working on machine vision to align the LiDAR beam on calibrartion target<br>
Mentor for Austin Schwartz (Uber)<br>
Intern working on data science to analyze historical trends in LiDAR calibration data<br>
